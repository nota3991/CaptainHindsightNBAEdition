Captain Hindsight NBA Edition

Noel Taterway and Dongjie Zhang

Questions we sought to answer:

Which pick historically results in the best possible player?

Based on the data of every draft, what is the true order of the draft?

What are the best and the worst picks to have?

If I am a NBA GM, “Am I happy with the 16th pick?” or “Do I need to trade my pick to get a better one?”

Answers

3	11	20	31	34	50

5	14	19	36	39	55

2	18	22	35	32	53

4	12	29	37	48	44

9	24	25	43	38	58

7	15	26	33	42	56

8	21	27	40	49	54

10	23	28	47	60	51

6	16	30	46	52	59

Worst picks to have: 6, 32, 44 (based of worth and actual position)

Best picks to have: 24, 45, 47, 60 (based of worth and actual position)

Based of the Data I am not happy with the 16th pick

Algorithms used for machine learning:

Recursive (RF), Decision tree (LR), and Random Forest (DT)

Application of Knowledge:

•	Using this data, you can found out which type of player you can draft at your pick at a better price.

•	For example, the 24th pick on average can give you the same amount of assist per game as the 7th pick.

•	The 45th pick can give you the same number of rebounds as 28th pick

•	48th pick can give you the same number of minutes as the 32nd

•	These stats when you look at in context have to be the same player.

•	If you pick a point guard at 24 you can possibly get a passer as good as a 7th pick, but that won’t work if you draft a center whose man job is to get rebounds.

•	What this truly tells us is the true probability of the pick being a bang or a bust.

•	Our data will not be consistent for every draft, but it is just showing the probability of how good this pick can truly be and what they can strive at.

•	Of course, there has been number #1 picks who have not been good, but majority of them are good players.  Pick 3 & 5 are better than pick 2 historically because more 3 & 5 picks have played well in their careers than pick 2

•	We are not saying that if you have the 31st pick you should trade it for the 45th pick because of the true order. Being the 31st pick you should have more confidence, due to the higher pick by probability and chance on paper. If you are the 45th pick though, you should have extreme confidence because even though you are a later pick, the data tells your pick will pan out.
